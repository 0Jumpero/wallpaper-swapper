## Setup for running script version

### Place API Key
To fetch wallpapers from Unsplash, you'll need an API key:
1. Create a free Unsplash developer account at [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers).
2. Generate an API key.
3. Replace the placeholder `key` in the settings.json (generated upon running script once) with your API key:
   
```json
{
    "key": "your-api-key",
}
```

### Or use the Included Database
If you don't want to fetch new wallpapers:
1. Copy the provided `wallpapers.json` file to:
   
```
C:\Users\Public\Pictures\Wallpapers\
```

### (Optional) Change the wallpaper topic (default: nature)
```json
{
  "query": "nature"
}
```

## Folder Structure

The script uses the following folder structure:
```
C:\
└── Users
    └── Public
        └── Pictures
            └── Wallpapers
                ├── home.png
                ├── lock.png
                ├── settings.json
                └── wallpapers.json

```
- home.png: The current desktop wallpaper.
- lock.png: The current lock screen wallpaper.
- settings.json: Settings for the wallpaper-swapper.
- wallpapers.json: The local database of wallpapers (created/updated by the script).

The script will automatically create these folders and files if they do not exist.

## Usage

### Fetch New Wallpapers from Unsplash:
  Ensure API key is set and valid in the settings.json.
  Change wallpaper topic if needed.
  Delete old wallpapers.json if present.
  Run the script.

### Use the Included Database:
  Place the wallpapers.json file in the correct folder.
  Run the script.

## Notes

  The script requires administrator privileges to change wallpapers and edit Windows Registry settings.
  If the wallpaper database contains fewer than 300 wallpapers, the script will fetch more from Unsplash automatically.
